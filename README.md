# 50 Days Coding Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my 50 Days Coding Challenge! 💻

I have taken up the challenge to solve programming questions from Leetcode for 50 consecutive days. This journey is a part of my commitment to improving my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and overall understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Progress 📈

### Array and Strings
- **Day 1:**
  - [Second largest element in the array](https://github.com/SanskarSh/50-Days-Coding-Challenge/tree/main/Second%20largest%20element%20in%20the%20array)
  - [Rotate array](https://github.com/SanskarSh/50-Days-Coding-Challenge/tree/main/Rotate%20array)
- **Day 2:**
  - [Equilibrium Index](https://github.com/SanskarSh/50-Days-Coding-Challenge/tree/main/Second%20largest%20element%20in%20the%20array)
  - [First Missing Positive](https://github.com/SanskarSh/50-Days-Coding-Challenge/tree/main/First%20Missing%20Positive)

## Motivation 🌟

The primary goal of this challenge is to consistently work on coding problems, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures. By maintaining a daily routine, I aim to reinforce key concepts and explore new challenges to enhance my proficiency in programming.

## How to Use 🤔

- Each day's solutions are stored in directories based on data structures and algorithms.
- Code files (e.g., `array_problem1.py`, `linkedlist_problem1.js`) contain the solutions for the respective days.
- README.md files provide explanations of the problems, approaches, and any additional notes.

## Getting Started 🚀

Feel free to explore the code and README files. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or questions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request. Your feedback is highly appreciated!

## Acknowledgments 🙏

I would like to express my gratitude to Leetcode for providing a platform to enhance my coding skills and to the community for the continuous support and inspiration.

Happy Coding! 🖥💻
