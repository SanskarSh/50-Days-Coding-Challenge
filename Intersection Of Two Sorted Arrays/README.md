# Day 6 - Array and String Problems 📚

## Problem: [Intersection Of Two Sorted Arrays](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/630526)

### Problem Statement 📝
You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of size 'N' and 'M' respectively. Both these arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. You have to find the intersection of these two arrays.

Intersection of two arrays is an array that consists of all the common elements occurring in both arrays.

**Note:**
```
1. The length of each array is greater than zero.
2. Both the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The output should be in the order of elements that occur in the original arrays.
4. If there is no intersection present then return an empty array.
```
## My Approach 🛠️
The algorithm efficiently finds the intersection of two sorted arrays, 'arr' and 'brr,' using two pointers. By iterating through both arrays simultaneously and comparing their elements, it identifies common elements, adding them to the 'intersection' list. The resulting list contains all elements that occur in both arrays while maintaining the original order.
