### Problem Statement 📝

You are given a matrix 'MATRIX' of dimension 'N' x 'M'. Your task is to make all the elements of row 'i' and column 'j' equal to 0 if any element in the ith row or jth column of the matrix is 0.

## My Approach 🛠️

I used a set to store the row and column numbers where 0 is present. Then I iterated through the matrix and if the row or column number is present in the set, I made the element 0.
