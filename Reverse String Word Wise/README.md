## Problem: [Reverse String](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/reverse-string-word-wise_1262348)

### Problem Statement 📝
Reverse the given string word-wise. The last word in the given string should come at 1st place, the last-second word at 2nd place, and so on. Individual words should remain as it is.

## My Approach 🛠️
1. *String Splitting:* Split the original string into a list of words.
   
2. *List Reversal:* Reverse the list of words.
   
3. *String Joining:* Join the reversed list back into a string.
