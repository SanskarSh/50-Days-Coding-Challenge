### Problem Statement 📝

You are given an array of integers 'ARR' of length 'N' and an integer Target. Your task is to return all pairs of elements such that they add up to Target. You cannot use the same element twice.

## My Approach 🛠️

I used a nested loop to iterate through the array and find the pairs that add up to the target. I then appended the indices of the pairs to the result list.
