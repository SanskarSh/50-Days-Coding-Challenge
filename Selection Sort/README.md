# Day 4 - Array and String Problems 📚

## Problem: [Selection Sort](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/selection-sort_981162)

### Problem Statement 📝
Selection sort is one of the sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning of the unsorted region of the array.

You are given an unsorted array consisting of N non-negative integers. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

## My Approach 🛠️
The provided Python implementation of selection sort iterates through the array, treating each element as a "pivot." It compares the pivot with every other element, swapping when a smaller one is found. While functional, this approach involves nested loops and may be less efficient for larger datasets. Consider exploring alternative sorting algorithms for improved performance.
